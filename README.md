# Introduction

This is a trivial repository that shows a strange issue with the maven compiler warning and its treatment of warnings.  While obviously you should ideally avoid code that generates warnings this particular example is based on real code generated by the Thrift compiler so it cannot be safely reworked to avoid the issue.

## The Issue

It contains a single source file that will produce Java compiler warnings (about unchecked or unsafe operations) and has two executions of the compiler plugin.  One should run with no warnings while the other with full warnings.

    > mvn clean compile

However the execution without any warnings always produces a warning despite the plugin settings saying that it should not.

## What is wrong?

Doing some digging this appears to be done to the fact that the warnings appearing in the Maven output are actually compiler "notes" and not warnings **but** Maven interprets them as warnings.

For example if you run the same command that Maven invokes `javac` with directly:

    > javac -d target/classes -classpath target/classes: -sourcepath src/main/java: -g -nowarn -target 1.5 -source 1.5 -encoding UTF-8 -Xlint:none src/main/java/example/DemonstrateMavenCompilerWarningsBug.java

Then it produces this output:

> Note: src/main/java/example/DemonstrateMavenCompilerWarningsBug.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
> Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.

Here we can see that these are notes.  However the maven compiler plugin appears to interpret this as a `WARNING` which is irritating to say the least especially if we've set the `<showWarnings>` configuration for the plugin to false (which also is the default behaviour).
